Welcome to SledBuild Remastered or (SBR for short). This is a complete rework of the original SledBuild gamemode created by GeXeH back in 2010.

If you are here because you want to play the game mode, you can suscribe it from the steam workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=000000000)

## About this project:
SBR was created because I think that this unique gamemode is very fun and interesting to let it die. I also felt like the original implementation was missing some crucial things that could have made the game mode even better.

So this project aims to do the following key things:
- Implement the original SledBuild but with more features.
- Try to keep the gameplay as competitive as possible.
- Provide an open source base for people to contribute.
- Enable mapping support for a wide variety of maps.
- Bring back the fun.

## Mapping:
If you would like to create a map for SBR you can follow [this guide](MAPPING_GUIDE) on how to do so. 

## Contributing:
Pull requests are more than welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Also, if you encountered a bug and wan’t to let me know you can create a new issue, or if it’s a minor thing you can contact me on Discord @ jotalanusse#1337
